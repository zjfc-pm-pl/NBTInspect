# NBTInspect
Inspect and edit entity / item NBT meta data by forms in-game
# Future Planning
It was created for debugging entity and tile NBTs, and item NBTs additionally. However, [as Dylan said](https://discord.com/channels/373199722573201408/430364566027763744/932019511257886762), this plugin is quite uesless. So it was discontinued about a year ago.

I planned to give this project a new life after I had learnt JSON UI. It will become an example for everyone and an instance of me using JSON UI in PocketMine-MP.
